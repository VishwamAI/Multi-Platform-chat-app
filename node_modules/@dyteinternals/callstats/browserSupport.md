# Browser support status report (and hacks)

## Supported Browsers/platforms

- Chrome (most supported)
- Firefox
- Safari

## Support Status

All browser functionalities extend from Chrome functionalities, and Safari functionalities extend from Firefox, which in turn extends from chrome. So features that are not supported in chrome currently would most likely not be supported by others as well.

## Chrome

Almost Completely supported, Precall test throughput, RTT, fractionalLoss, jitter, backendRTT are not supported

Undefined/Unsupported fields mandated by WebRTC specs:

 - ProducerReport.VideoStats.framesDropped
 - ProducerReport.VideoStats.qualityLimitationReason
 - TransportReport.stats.iceRole
 - ConsumerReport.AudioStats.concealedSampels

 - PrecallNetworkInformation.[throughput, RTT, fractionalLoss, jitter, backendRTT]    (soon to be fixed)

## Firefox

Undefined/Unsupported fields mandated by WebRTC specs:

 - ProducerReport.VideoStats.[encoderImplementation, framesSent, hugeFramesSent, keyFramesEncoded, qualityLimitationReason, qualityLimitationResolutionChanges, qualityLimitationDurations, retransmittedBytesSent, retransmittedPacketsSent, totalEncodeTime, totalPacketSendDelay]

 - ProducerReport.[VideoStats, AudioStats].remoteData.[fractionLoss, roundTripTimeMeasurements]

 - TransportReport.stats.[availableOutgoingBitrate, dtlsCipher, dtlsState, iceRole, packetsReceived, packetsSent, totalRoundTripTime]

 - ConsumerReport.VideoStats.[decoderImplementation, frameWidth, frameHeight, framesDropped, keyFramesDecoded, framesRecieved]
 - ConsumerReport.AudioStats.[concealedSampels, audioLevel, concealmentEvents, jitterBufferDelay, jitterBufferEmittedCount, totalAudioEnergy, totalSamplesDuration, totalSamplesReceived]
 
 - PrecallNetworkInformation.[effectiveNetworkType, throughput, RTT, fractionalLoss, jitter, backendRTT]    (soon to be fixed)

Some fields are not provided by getStats() API so they are gathered using various methods -->

- ### Producer Video Stream Width/Height/FPS

	These values are gathered from producer.track.getSettings() which provides width/height/fps

- ### Consumer Video Stream Width/Height/FPS

	These values are currently not supported as there is no simple way to get these as consumer.track.getSettings() returns empty dict

- ### TransportReport.stats.[bytesSent, bytesReceived]

	As firefox transport.getStats() API does not return any transport entry, we substitute these values from candidate-pair entry's values. These values should be the same for the candidate-pair belonging to the transport.

- ### TransportReport.stats.[roundTripTime, roundTripTimeMeasurements]

	As firefox getStats()'s candidate-pair entry lacks roundTripTime entry, For the producing transport, we take the max RTT from producer video/audio's remote-inbound-rtp roundTripTime entries. For consuming transport, these values are 0 as there are no entries to fetch these at all.

## Safari

Safari's measurements toolkit implementation is extended from firefox.

Undefined/Unsupported fields mandated by WebRTC specs:

 - ProducerReport.VideoStats.[encoderImplementation, framesSent, hugeFramesSent, qualityLimitationReason, qualityLimitationResolutionChanges, qualityLimitationDurations, totalEncodeTime, totalPacketSendDelay]

 - ProducerReport.AudioStats.nackCount

 - ProducerReport.[VideoStats, AudioStats].remoteData.[fractionLoss, jitter, packetsLost, totalRoundTripTime, roundTripTimeMeasurements]

 - TransportReport.stats.[iceRole, packetsReceived, packetsSent, totalRoundTripTime]

 - ConsumerReport.VideoStats.[decoderImplementation, framesDropped, framesPerSecond, framesRecieved, jitter]

 - ConsumerReport.AudioStats.[concealedSampels, audioLevel, concealmentEvents, jitterBufferDelay, jitterBufferEmittedCount, totalAudioEnergy, totalSamplesDuration, totalSamplesReceived]
 
 - PrecallNetworkInformation.[effectiveNetworkType, throughput, RTT, fractionalLoss, jitter, backendRTT]    (soon to be fixed)

Some fields are not provided by getStats() API so they are gathered using various methods -->

- ### Producer Video Stream Width/Height/FPS

	These values are gathered from producer.track.getSettings() which provides width/height/fps

- ### Consumer Video Stream Width/Height/FPS

	These values are gathered from consumer.track.getSettings() which provides width/height/fps unlike firefox

- ### TransportReport.stats.[roundTripTime, roundTripTimeMeasurements]

	As firefox getStats()'s candidate-pair entry lacks roundTripTime entry, For the producing transport, we take the max RTT from producer video/audio's remote-inbound-rtp roundTripTime entries. For consuming transport, these values are 0 as there are no entries to fetch these at all.
